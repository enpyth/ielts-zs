Do you like visiting art galleries?   Yes, of course I like visiting galleries many times a year before the lockdown made by government, because of the cover 19 in 2020.   The most impressed me is a painting  exhibition  In Shanghai art museum, same likes the zima blue which is an art in American TV series named  Love death and robot.

Do you want to be an artist?   Yes, I’m glad to be an artist in some way. I’m a programmer and my job is coding in stock exchange.   In my work, I code for some component and exchange system which is my work of art if I’m a artist.

 Do you like modern art or traditional art?    I like modern art more because I couldn’t appreciate the traditional art sometimes.   In my leisure time, I’m willing to listen absolute music.
