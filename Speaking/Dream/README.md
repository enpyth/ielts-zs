## What was your childhood dream?
I dream of being an athlete since I'm a children. When I was young, I was invited to join in the sports team in my primary school  because I run so fast. And then I represented my school in the 100m sport event  in regional district.  But I completely give up my dream to be an athlete as I was in 15 years old, because I didn't achieve good grades and I realize I couldn't be an athlete. 

## Are you the kind of person who sticks to dream?
I'm not a lucky dog who could pursuit their aspirations. I think dream is used to be imaged and memorized, so only few people could stick to their aspiration no matter how hard it is. Dream is great and hard to achieve, no one naturally want to be a truck driver. So I won't stick to my dream and I give up my dream. 

## What is your dream job?
Today, I'm a programmer and I code for my program. In the future, I want to  continuously  be a programmer. My dream not change, but I won't make my job responsibility for demand of my work or the need of project.  I wish I could code for open-source software, such as Kubernetes which is a program of dispatcher for cloud computation sponsored by Google. Because I want to achieve a masterpiece and continuously  optimize it.

## Do you think you are an ambitious person?
I'm not an ambitious person, because my ability could not support my ambitions.  If I apply myself so hard and squeeze my every potential, but I fail in the end, I would feel stressful and depressed. As a result, I would rather live a peace and tranquil life.
