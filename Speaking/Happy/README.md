# Is there anything that has made you feel happy lately ?
My tutor, a senior professor in ECNU, let me reserve a meeting unexpectly  several days ago. I don't know why he ask me suddenly, since I have been graduated for three years. Then I didn't response my tutor in a hurry and ask my junior student in school what happened. As a result, my tutor mixed up my name and a name of another student who reserve the meeting day in and day out. I feel happy because it reminds me of my happy school time and push I communicate my classmate not in touch for long time.

# What made you happy when you were little ?
The weekend with my parents made me happy when I was little. On every weekend, my parents bring me to play in botanical garden where it has beautiful scene and several interesting facilities. My happiest thing is to ride the roller coaster over and over again, and when I'm tired of playing, I'll go to McDonald's for a children's meal. That is really happy time, I could't remake it anymore since I grow up.

It depends on how much people expect from the product. People would feel happy, if the new things meet the expectation for people.
