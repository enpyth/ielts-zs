# Do you often bring a lot of keys with you ?
I only bring three keys in my routine. The two keys are for the entrance of the unit building and my apartment, and the remaining key is for my bicycle.

# Have you ever lost your keys ?
I haven't lost the key in my memory. When I go out, I keep my keys in my backpack which is never lost, so I haven't lost my keys. At home, my keys are kept in a fixed position, so I never forget where the keys are.

# Do you often forget the keys and lock yourself out ?
I occasionally forget the key, but even if I forget the key, I won't lock myself out. I keep my spare key in the drawer of my company's workstation. If I forget the key, I would go to the company to get it, or I will just flip into the room through the window, so I have never locked myself out.

# Do you think it a good idea to leave your keys with a neighbour ?
I don't think so. Placing the key with a neighbour means that the neighbor needs to leave a specific space for storing odds and ends from their strange neighbor, and remember that someone leave a key in their house. I am not willing to disturb others in this way.
