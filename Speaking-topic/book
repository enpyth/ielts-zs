# 书

我唯一读过多次的英语书是little prince，这本书非常有名，我还没读这本书的时候就听说过王子和小狐狸的故事。

今年上半年我读过起码5次，其实并不是特别喜欢这本书，而是为了学习英语而读。

My English teacher told me that I could learn how native speaker tell a story or describe their thought and emotion. What's more, he recommand that I should make shadowing exercise, but that beyound my abilities.

To be honest, I'm tired by the romantic story in a love triangle with them maybe because I am really a grown-up. What the most incredibly impressed me is the tippler who is a nobody present in the shortest chapter. 

Little prince ask him why you drink? Drink for forgetting.
Forget for what? Forget for shame.
Shame for what? Shame for drinking.

The brief conversation completely touched me as if I experienced myself. In fact, the real reason of drinking is for forgetting the noise in my body, which disturb and shame me. But I don't have to share my shame to others and the shame is my private memory which is impossible to explain. In consequence, I could only say that I shame for drinking.

In addition, I'm same as the tipper who settle down in silence before empty bottle and fully bottle, I just collect empty bottle in my corner and freeze my beer in my fridge. I adore the story which give my opportunity of meeting myself.
