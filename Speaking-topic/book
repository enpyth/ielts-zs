The only English book I have read several times is Little Prince, which is one of most renowned books in the world so that I heard about the story of the prince and the little fox before I even read it.

I have read this book at least 5 times this year. Instead of adoring this book, I read it just for the purpose of learning English. My English teacher told me that I could learn how native speaker tell a story or describe their thought and emotion. What's more, he recommends that I should do shadowing exercises, but that is beyond my abilities.

To be honest, I'm tired by the romantic story in a love triangle with them perhaps because I am really a grown-up. What the most incredibly impressed me is the tippler who is nobody presents in the shortest chapter. 

Little prince ask him why you drink? Drink to forget.
Forget for what? Forget for shame.
Shame for what? Shame for drinking.

The brief conversation completely touched me as if I experienced myself. I could feel that the real reason for drinking is for forgetting the noise in my body, which disturbs and shames me. But I don't have to share my shame with others and the shame is my private memory which is difficult and impossible to explain. In consequence, I could only say that I am ashamed of drinking.

In addition, I'm the same as the tipper who settles down in silence before empty bottle and full bottle, I just collect empty bottle in corner of my room and freeze my beer in my fridge. I adore the story which gives me the opportunity of meeting myself.
