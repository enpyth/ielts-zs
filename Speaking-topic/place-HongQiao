The place I want to introduce is Hongqiao Railway Station in Shanghai, which is the largest express railway station in Shanghai. Many people flock here to take trains to their destination all year round so that it's a place ...

In China, the economic development of different cities varies greatly. As the largest city in eastern China, Shanghai provides abundant employment opportunities, and a large amount of labor relies on express rail to enter and exit Shanghai. Therefore, there are huge crowds of people at the Hongqiao railway station, which usually contributed to the station into chaos.

People from all walks in each along across waiting hall, where passengers could not listen to others because this place is filled with noise of people and station, it's difficult to find a silent comer except VIP room. The large number of people leads to high air temperature although air condition is running all the time, so that I could smell the disgusting smell from toilet.

During the New Year, the labor force returns from Shanghai to their hometown to celebrate holidays, or students go to school or travel during winter and summer vacations, the situation is a messy free-for-all. And I hope to escape this city one day. I detest the model of pursuing urban prosperity at the cost of human living environment here.
