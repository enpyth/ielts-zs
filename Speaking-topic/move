I have a friend who was my high school classmate. After high school, we left our hometown and came to Shanghai to attend university. We got postgraduate degree and found a job in Shanghai 3 years ago. Now, we live in different places.

After graduation, my friend and his girlfriend lived in a small house in a remote area of Zhoupu in the south of Shanghai, in order to save money and buy a house. Two months ago, they moved to an old community near the front beach that is conveniently located in the outskirts area. The complex is only a few minutes' walking distance to hospital, numerical stores, restaurants, and recovery facilities.

The reason they moved is because they are preparing to have a child. Moving early to avoid the action perhaps affects their health in case of pregnancy, and for her wife could commute conveniently, this new home is only ten minutes' walking distance to her workplace.

It cut both ways. The couple look forward to enjoying their family life and are fond of raising their baby, that will come true, I feel happy for them, even if I don't really like children. But this matter has some negative effects on me. In the future, he must take care of his family, which means that I rarely can enjoy our alcohol time on weekends.
