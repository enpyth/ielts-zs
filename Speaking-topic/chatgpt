People who follow the latest technology of AI could catch that OpenAI has released chatGPT based on big language model technology, which could be used to get instant answers, find creative inspiration, and learn something new.

1) The cutting-edge invention is quite useful. 
2) The cutting-edge technology products is quite hard to use.
3) I'm craving for learning how to use it. 
4) I visit the homepage of chatGPT almost every day.
5) I can't wait to share the incredible chagGPT with my parents and teach them how to play it.

# advantages: idea review debug
Usually, I would use chatgpt as a work assistant. Firstly, after receiving a work task, I would try to understand the term and the aim for the task during the research phase. Once I find the problem I need to deal with, I would request Chatgpt to provide steps to solve the problem for me. Then I cannot solve this task right now, but rather need to share a pre for the leader and team members to review my work plan includes background, what the problem is, compare different ways to deal with it and schedule time. At this time, I will have ChatGPT generate a document describing my task overview for me. Finally, I have chatgpt generate functions or algorithms according to my requirements such as complexity of time and space, and I will put these codes into my project, usually the code generated by chatgpt is excellent and could meet my expectation.

# disadvantages: vpn
Unfortunately, OpenAI is open to most countries except for some special ones such as China. However, I have become accustomed to how to use the Incomplete Internet. I bought a VPN tool and had my sister in Australia help me apply for an account to use the chat service. Nevertheless, it's an arduous process to use this unstable and provisional service. Occasionally, I usually be denied access and warned that I am not authorized, or my VPN address will be directly blocked. At this time, I can only try to fix my access channel, such as pretending to make my HTTP request for overseas access. Once, I thought I could ask chatgpt how to tackle this issue, but it was identified as a sensitive topic and cannot be told to me. I have not yet figured out how to completely manage it. I have had enough of technology being influenced by politics, which disgusted me.
