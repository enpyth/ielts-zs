# 重要事情的迟到经历

I want to share my life experience of I am late for cramming when I was a high school student, I should have got better academic performance in my college entrance examination.

Exam-oriented education may restrict students' creativity and couse students to study intensively, which aganist with my instinct, at that time I just want to lost in electronical games and a pretty girl who was an apple of my eye. Actually it cut both ways, maybe I'm a wild animal hard to tamed, but I am also a go-getter once I make up my mind to pursuit my aspiration.

The aim for education should allow children find their aspiration, rather than kill their opportunity in certain standardised test. After the exam, I concentrate on my studies although I have no good educational resources so that I finished my postgraduate qualifications 3 years ago and got a resonable career. Today, I craving for a doctor degree and specialising in cs, the experience of I am late does not bother me, but it is an incredibly arduous process.
