# 新开的店
# 不寻常的一餐
# 有趣的工作

Yes, sure. After working, I went with my colleagues to have dinner near my community in the business area. Attractive slogans catch me and I realize it's the latest pub in the street. 

I came in and the waiter told me that they are at the stage of promoting their offerings, but they sell nothing because they need to wait for the license and some certification, so I could order some beers for free. I order an American IPA, which taste not bitter than others I had drunk. It's clean, not bad, but I couldn't feel the perfume of tropical fruits. 

And I asked the waiter, "What's your favorite beer?" He answered me that he like the German wheat beer. So, I ordered one. It tastes good. I think the concentration of the wheat relative higher than other wheat beer. This tastes like a wheat juice. 

I really adore this pub. In the next year, I intend to resign from my job, and I would like to share my alcohol time with my colleague in this pub.
