# 投诉让你满意

Since August last year, I have been continuously complaining to the Consumer Protection Association about a fitness center where I exercise in the past 3 years.

The reason for the complaint is that there was deceptive behavior in the sales of the gym, which using the excuse of promotional activities to induce me into purchasing another advanced fitness card and saying that the gym will be upgraded, and the current fitness cards cannot be used anymore after the upgrade. All of this is just for get my money by all means.

Three years ago, I was also skeptical when I purchased the membership, but the contract stated that I am entitled to get a 70% refund if I give up the membership. In fact, the gym eats its word and did not fulfill its obligation to refund 70% of the money. The Consumer Protection Association of Shanghai Municipal Government received my complaint, but no one came to handle my issue, and no one inquired about the results and feedback of my complaint.

The behavior of the gym and the government has disappointed me, but I am very satisfied with the results of the complaint. Because this made me realize that I am living in deception and lies, shutdowns have caused the bankrupt of the fitness center, and incompetent governments are unable to handle the economic impact of shutdowns and foolish policies.

In the future the messy free-for-all will be present in all industries. What's more, the complaint is part of reason help me decide to escape there and thank for the experience cure my potential homesick when I live oversea.
