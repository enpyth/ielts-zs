When I was younger, I used to love playing computer games, and one of my favorites was called "Dragon Nest." It was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that was really popular at the time.

The game was set in a fantasy world where you created your own character and went on quests and adventures with other players from around the world. There were different classes to choose from, such as archer, warrior, cleric, and sorceress, each with their own unique skills and abilities.

What I loved about Dragon Nest was the storyline. Thinking back, I believe this game is probably that I am a fresh man, and I could develop my skills in the process of explore the virtual world, and the bosses are dragons. If I conquer a dragon, then I can challenge the next stronger dragon.

The most interesting part is the cat and mouse game between me and my mother. I seize every opportunity to play games, but my mother prevents me from playing games. My mother often hides the monitor behind the sofa, but later she hides the power cord. Sometimes I went to buy a power cord after school and then went home. Once, I hid the power cord behind two books on the bookshelf, but after dinner, I realized that my power cord was missing. 

It must have been my mother who took it, as the saying goes, 'No one knows a man better than his own mother.'. I dared not ask my mother where my power cord was, and she pretended that nothing had happened.
