有一天我在youtube上看到了牛津大学有一个节日活动，学生们乘坐自己制作的纸船在学校的河上比赛谁划得远。后来youtube推荐了我更多视频，我发现在国外很多人会以皮划艇作为户外运动，这非常吸引我，因为我很热爱这种参与感强的运动，并且这是很好的探索自然的机会with my own pace.

One day I saw a festival event at Oxford University on YouTube, where students row a boat made by themself by paper to compete on the school's river, which attracts me. Then, YouTube recommended me more videos like this, and I found that many people abroad take rafting as an outdoor sport, which is very attractive to me because I haven't saw these activities in China, I fond of this kind of interesting sport and it is a great opportunity to explore nature on my own pace.

我今年在关注澳洲的城市，因为我很可能要去澳洲学习生活一段时间。living in steel and concrete forests, i was catched by塔斯马尼亚州吸引了我，这是澳洲自然生态保护最完善的地方，这片美丽纯净的土地，有较大的未开发天然地带。我希望如果有机会我想自己或者和朋友在这里玩皮划艇，探索这片tranquil and serene state. 

I pay attention to cities in Australia this year because I am planning to study and live in Australia for a period. Perhaps living in steel and concrete forests for a long time, I was caught by Tasmania, which is the most well protected natural ecology in Australia. This beautiful and pure land has a large undeveloped natural zone. I hope I can have the opportunity to raft here with myself or friends and explore this tranquil and serene state.

我是个喜欢独处的人，所以我觉得我可能会喜欢一个人探险，有时候会幻想未来在某一天的假日，把我的皮划艇、运动装备、补给放到车上，一个人开车去某个干净的湖泊上rafting的场景。做这件事前我一定会仔细规划，最重要的就是安全问题，我会害怕我在rafting的时候水里突然出现一条鳄鱼或是可怕的动物攻击我。

I adore being lost in my own world, so I feel I enjoy exploring alone. Sometimes I imagine a holiday in the future, where I will put my canoe, sports equipment, and supplies in my car and drive alone to a write lake for rafting. Before doing this, I will be specific in my itinerary, and the most important thing is safety. I feel afraid that a crocodile or a formidable animal will suddenly appear in the water and attack me when I enjoy rafting.

每当想到自己旅行的时候会有安全隐患，就会想那还不如去黄金海岸这种城市，这里看上去好像更悠闲自在，适合与家人享受度假时光。

Whenever I think of safety hazards when traveling alone, I think it's better to go to a city like the Gold Coast, which looks safe and sound and suitable for enjoying holiday time with my family.
