Everything Everywhere All at Once

At the 95th Academy Awards in March this year, Everything Everywhere All at Once made a clean sweep and won servious of awards, including best film, best director and best original script, and helped Chinese actress Michelle Yeoh and Guan Jiwei win the best actress and best supporting actor awards respectively. 

1) That sounds great, right? The film completely disappointed me.
2) Having been a symbol of Eastern action actresses, Michelle Yeoh set the benchmark for Chinese kongfu performed by a women. She has a beautiful appearance and a agile figure from movies, which can be said to be a blend of beauty, elegance, and strength.
3) That sounds great, right? Those information completely confused me.

Instead of having the beautiful and elegant image in this film, Michelle Yeoh portraying the exhausted laundry owner to the core. But the movie doesn't meet my expectation and disappointed me. 

It makes me feel like this is an award driven work. This film caters to people's stereotypical impressions of Asian families, such as a typical East Asian problem with an unhappy native family, including a proud but incompetent father, a weak mother who is busy for raising children and doing household chores, and a successful, stern but unfriendly grandfather. Make a difficult living in multicultural society, the Aisa suddenly realized that life is the most important thing, and then love has saved everything.

The file is same as a phenomenon called overfitting: If we supply too much data into our model, the model will be created perfectly, but just for that data. The blockbuster swept the board, but I detest the overfitting data.
