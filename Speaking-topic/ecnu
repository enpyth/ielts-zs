# 开学第一天

I remember a time six years ago when I intended to get dinner with my parents after taking the exam of postgraduate entrance.

That night, I took part in a programming exam, which is an important part of the interview for postgraduate entrance. I messed it up because I can't work out the algorithm problem. I only deal with one or two in eight problems. After that, I came out the school and went to global harbor, which is a landmark in Shanghai near my school to find my parents to get dinner.  At this time, I got lost. When I came out of school, I just found a random way to walk forward with no thinking because I may lose my golden opportunity. And I didn't realize I chose the opposite orientation until I found a river in front of me. Then I reorient myself and make it to my destination.

Fortunately, my school qualified me and gave me an offer. Three years ago, I got the academic qualification of master's degree in the school, the east China normal university.
