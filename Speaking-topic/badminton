The person I'd like to describe is my badminton coach, who happens to be a very popular figure in the world of badminton. Her name is YuNa, and she used to be a consummate athlete for the Chinese badminton team.

// YuNa is an incredibly talented coach, with abundant teaching experience and passion. She has a reputation for being tough on her athletes especially in posture and movement, but it's only because she believe the amateur is prone to be hurt. I agree with her, the aim of exercise is not to pursuit achievement, rather than build up a good physique and improve one's health.

She is not only a tough badminton coach, but also a life mentor. She would like to share her experience when she went to Japan and played for the Chinese national team with us, as well as interesting stories about her following from all walks of life, even she created an opportunity for me and another girl to have a romantic relationship. So everyone adore playing badminton with her.

I met her by chance. I met her several times while playing at the badminton gym. Her passion for teaching and professional skills attracted me. Honest is the best policy, I just asked if I could learn badminton from her, and she agreed because of my sincere attitude and craving for badminton. Since then, I have been learning badminton with her every week.

The person I'd like to describe is a consummate athlete named LinDan.

If someone win one of events, the one has the title of champion and its name would be writen in the history of badminton. If someone win all the enents, the one has the title of Grand Slam and would be a member of a badminton hall of fame. LinDan, the only one athlete who win the Grand Slam two time, is called SuperDan.

Actually, What I adore the most about Lin Dan is his sportsmanship. Lin Dan will never give up any points, even if his opponent has won the match point and his score falls far behind. He made incredible impressions by turning the tide in the sport events. Moreover, at the end of his career, he changed his playing style and focused more on landing point and strategy, rather than relying on physical fitness and violent smash to win games, which greatly extended his career.

Lindan is a role model for me, his strong willpower and passion for badminton impressed me.

Once I took part in a competition in the company I work for, and I have high expectations for this, but eventually I lose my match in group stage. I felt so depressed about I even can't have the ability to enter the knockout stage. YuNa consoled me that everyone would lose the game except the champion, you should cheer up and find the weakness to overcome.

I feel very fortunate to have had Zhang Wei as my coach and mentor when I was playing badminton. She taught me how to face failure and what is the true sportsmanship.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF) organizes and hosts several major international badminton tournaments throughout the year. For example, the Olympic Games is the biggest and most prestigious event in all sports, including badminton. 

Badminton competitions are held all year round, so I always watch them whenever I have time. I like watching men's and women's singles competitions the most. I appreciate that the male athletes utilize their bodies to exert their ultimate speed and strength, and I also into that the female athletes' techniques and strategies and I tend to simulate the perform in my own sports.
